         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That was to forſake them, if they forſake me; This is never to forſake them, nor they me; <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people;</hi> that I will be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169702:20"/> their God, if they be my people: 7. That was to be taught of Men; This is to be taught of God; <hi>they ſhall all know me:</hi> 8.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169702:69"/> enemy that increaſes and riſes up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us and the Lord, and it is the Lord, that Spirit, that ſmites this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the cheek bone, and breaks the teeth of the ungodly; ſo all ſalvation is the Lords, and his bleſſing is his people. Again, The Lord is their Sacrifice of Righteouſneſſe, their Wealth and Health, and all the light of his Countenance is that which is their Life indeed; the Lord is their Life and Peace, that makes them to dwell in ſafety alone; their wine, and corn, and oyl, it is all with the Lord alone, and nothing elſe. What ſinging was there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the birth of Chriſt Jeſus after the fleſh? How did the Angel, Shepherds, <hi>Joſeph, Mary, Zachary, Elizabeth, Simeon,</hi> and all ſing? How did they all magnifie the Lord, and bleſs the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> What is it but an example of the heavenly Thing, that when Chriſt Jeſus is born in us, and framed there, there is ſinging, and will be where the Lord lives; But all the minſtrels in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169702:70"/> the fleſh are turned out, and it calls them all madneſs: yea, there is a ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing though we be in priſon outwardly, and great miſery, yet our joy none can take from us; nothing can break out peace, nor interrupt our melody, nor quench our joy; no man nor devil can take it from us.</p>

                     <hi>The ſum of this hiſtory of</hi> Proverbs <hi>ſpiritually in us in five particulars; The Father God, the Mother Wiſdom, the Son the Saint.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HEre is five things ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Father, and that is the Lord God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Mother, and that is Wiſdom, ſo ſhe is called; Wiſdom is juſtified of her children, which is Chriſt; God, the Father of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Chriſt, the Mother of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; here is Judgment and Wiſdom together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Son, that is here ſpoken of in the hiſtory of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, and that is the Childe of God, the Chriſtian, or Saint, that begotten
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169702:73"/> Son that came from the bowels of Wiſdom, travelling with it, and from the ſpirit of Judgment; this is the Son that is ſo much admoniſhed and taught of God every way; it muſt needs be a wiſe Son that hath ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and it cannot ſtand in need of any thing that hath ſuch a Father, it muſt needs be brought up in the <hi>nurture</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord, filled with all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding. A wiſe ſon, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> is a joy to his mother, but a fooliſh one is the ſorrow of her heart; So here, Wiſdoms children are a joy to her; She can ſay, Lord, here am I, and the children thou haſt given me I had from thee, thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me, and I give them to thee again, and my ſelf with them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ſtrange woman and her ſons, the woman that flattereth with her lips, and ſpeaketh lies; what is this woman, but the world? and the children of this woman, but the children of the world? This fleſh that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169702:73"/> dwells in us, is the ſtrange woman, and the woman that flattereth with her lips, and betrays us, tempting us to come in unto her, and ſee what ſhe hath prepared. This is the Antichriſt that lives in fleſh, and would feign her ſelf a Propheteſs, and would have all turn in to her, and drink of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, and eat of her idolatrous ſacrifices, which ſhe hath prepared. And all her ſons are the brats of <hi>Babel,</hi> the concupiſcence or luſt of the fleſh. 2. The luſt of the eye and heart. 3. The pride of life. Theſe three be her darlings and <hi>Delilahs</hi> that are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and brought up by her dayly, the ſtrange woman and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The enemies of Wiſdom, and theſe be called fools and ſcorners, ſinners and ſtrangers; theſe hate knowledg, and reject the fear of the Lord: She hath called, and they would not anſwer, yea, cryed, but they would not hear. She hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her table and her banquets, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169702:74"/> cryed in the high ways and concourſe of people, to come in to be her gueſts, but they have all turned aſide, yea, they hate her dainties, and deſpiſe her counſels, preferring, with <hi>Eſau,</hi> a meſs of pottage before either bleſſing or birth-right.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169702:82"/> Heaven, Fleſh and Spirit: There ſhall then be neither proverb, nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, nor dark ſaying; no ſealed books, nor ſealed fountain; no ſecrets nor myſteries; but all things ſhall be manifeſt, for the Day ſhall declare them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Purely, now he is the pure Being and Fountain of all things, in whom is light, or he is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all: There is no mixture at all with God, the throne of the Lord and the Lamb, from thence come the chryſtal waters of life pure and clear.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Powerfully, he ſpeaks with Authority, and not as the Scribes; he ſpeaks, and brings forth his word, and it is done: All things are at his command, he calls, and all obey, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> and it is ſo; <hi>Be it according to thy faith,</hi> and it was ſo: <hi>I will be thou clean,</hi> and it was ſo: <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and I will give thee life;</hi> And how is this?

                  <p>O <hi>Thou whom my ſoul loveth!</hi> This is a heavenly voyce breathed out by the Spirit, a divine flame of love; by which it appears, how the Spouſe was ſick of love, and nothing but death without his preſence, And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that all Gods teachings and workings, towards his people, are all in lone; His very Rod and Staff is in love; He loveth every Childe whom he correcteth: And ſo the Soul that loves the Lord truly, though the Lord kill him, yet will he put his truſt in the name of the Lord. Such a thing is love, that though it wander a while in the wilderneſs, and loſe it ſelf, yet it will finde out the way; nothing can quench it, no waters; nothing can kill it, no death; nothing can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it, no torment, no defence; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can diminiſh it, or any way choke it, but the thing it lives upon;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169702:83"/> and where it loves, there it lives. What other argument could the Spouſe bring to move God; As his love conſtrains us, ſo will our love to him conſtrain him, draw him, and he will run after us, fall about our necks and kiſs us. I remember, in the hiſtory of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> ſent to Chriſt this meſſage, <hi>Lord, he whom thou loveſt is ſick.</hi> They thought that was enough; he knew well whom they meant, and they knew well how much that would prevail upon him, to which Chriſt returns, <hi>This ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God,</hi> and ſo it was: His love to Chriſt made him ſick, and Chriſts love to him made him well; Therefore ſaith <hi>Mary, Lord, hadſt thou been here, my brother had not dyed.</hi> Chriſts abſence was his death, and his preſence brings him life.</p>

                  <p>NOw there are five things that ſhews forth the excellency of this love of the Spouſe to Chriſt, that it will deſerve the name of a ſoul love, and a ſound love.</p>
                  <p>The 1. is, Where this love is, it is a love above all loves whatſoever, no other love comparable to it, it endures to the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169702:85"/> end, it will bear all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believe all things, hope all things, and endure all things; though other loves fail, but this doth not, it is of a more excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from an excellent Principle, from a divine Spirit; there is no love in the world like it, it being tranſcendent and ſupernatural.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a love before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves, this the beſt, the love that commands all the reſt: For where the ſoul is, all elſe is; there is mind, will and affections; it ſits at uppermoſt room, hath the higheſt place in our hearts, all the reſt bow down to this ſheafe, to this love; here they all cover their faces, and pull down their top ſails.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This ſoul love is a love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all loves whatſoever, beyond the love of husband and wife, parents or children, beyond the love of other men, women, brethren or friends, nay An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves; for all theſe loves may exceed their bounds, and then prove hurtful; but let them keep
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169702:85"/> their bounds, and then they fall very ſhort of this infinite and exceeding weight of love: For though the Lord hath ſet bounds to Seas, and other Creatures, nay to men, women and children, thus far you muſt love, and no further; but here are no bounds nor limits to this ſoul love: Love him with all thy ſoul, thy heart, thy ſtrength: It is a love beyond all love whatſoever, it is larger, higher, deeper, longer, broader then any love elſe; that made the Apoſtle cry out, and this will, if rightly underſtood, make us cry out, <hi>O the heighth, depth, bredth, length of the love of Saints to the Lord! O thou whom my ſoul loveth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is a love without all, a naked, free, pure love, not for ends, gain, or ought elſe, not for any reward or wages; as Satan would have accuſed <hi>Job</hi> to God to have done, ſaying, <hi>Doth Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> No, no, <hi>Job</hi> knows what he doth, and knows what he gets by it, or elſe he would never be ſo ſerviceable as he is; whereas indeed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169702:86"/> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> ſerved God without all, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and truly, for the Lords ſake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not his own ſake at all: this is called a love without all, out of love, and not of fear to him.</p>
                  <p>The fifth and laſt is, To love the Lord in all, which is indeed good, though it be not ſo high &amp; excellent as the other, for to love God without all, as <hi>Job</hi> did, when the Lord ſtript him, as I may ſay, ſtark naked, left him hardly a rag, nay almoſt took his life away beſides, yet in the midſt of this it is ſaid, <hi>he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, but bleſſed God, who giveth and taketh; bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> And again, <hi>Though thou kill me, yet will I put my truſt in thee.</hi> This is a greater degree of love, nay a ſtronger love, to love the Lord without all, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples ſaid, <hi>Lord we have left all and folowed thee.</hi> There is more of God in this, then to love God in all, when we have what heart can deſire, the Lord filling ful our cup, every one that hath the ſmoaking flax, can be praiſing God when they are wel &amp; proſper, enjoying
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169702:86"/> richly every thing; but few in death, ſickneſs, wars, miſery, want, nakedneſs in the Croſs, can ſay, <hi>Bleſsed be the Lord.</hi>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169702:87"/> though the laſt in execution.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lords ſoul love is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all; O the heighth depth, bredth, length of this Love! <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi> And again, Who loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his Love. And again, When we were ſinners and enemies, Chriſt dyed for the ungodly. And again, God firſt loved us, and behold what manner of loveit was, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lords Love it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all, without money, or money worth, <hi>Ho, ho, every one that thirsteth, come to the waters and drink, come, buy wine and milk without money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price.</hi> And again, When he ſaw us in our blood, he ſaid unto us live, then was the time of love.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, And his love is within all; for all things are beloved and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for our ſakes and good; he bleſſes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169702:87"/> all we take in hand, goings in and comings out, abroad and at home, in ſoul and body, being his trees planted by his living waters, and always bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his fruits, and whatſoever we do he proſpers it: This is the Lords love to his people, and how can they chuſe but love him thus then, and make him the Beloved of their ſouls, for he alone is worthy; for he is ſweet, gracious, holy, heavenly, wiſe, bleſſed, the faireſt amongſt ten thouſand; he is all fair; indeed there is no ſpot in him.</p>
